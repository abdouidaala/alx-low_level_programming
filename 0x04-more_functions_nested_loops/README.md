# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Objectives
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Requirements
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files will be compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`

## Running command

```bash
  gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c <main.c> <my_program.c> -o <my_program>
```
